# Algorithms-in-JS
Commonly used Algorithms implemented in Javascript

If you're like me, you probably love JS.  Whether you want to explore new algorithms or brush up on some that you've learned in the past, I hope this repo helps. My goal is to provide a repository where common algorithms are implemented in our most beloved language, JS, in an easy-peasy manner. I'm only human, so there may be some errors. You can contribute by pointing them out!
